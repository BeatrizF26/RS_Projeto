# RS Project
This project involves designing and configuring a communication network for a company, using both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, VLAN's, routing protocols and security measures. The etwork configuration includes public and private IPv4 address ranges, global IPv6 addresses and specific security and routing protocols to ensure efficient and secure internal and external communication.

## Main Requirements:
- Properly define and configure public and private IPv4 subnets and global IPv6 addresses for the network.
- Implement OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 for internal routing and BGP for external communication between autonomous systems.
- Configure firewall rules and traffic filtering to secure network access and restrict specific ports for internal and external communications.
